Generate a scene and roadway
Place car lanewise starting with lane 1 (rightmost)

`car_pos_array` Array with initial position of each car. Car i will be placed in lane i at that position
`car_vel_array` Array with initial velocities. Defaults to 0 velocities

lane_place_array: Every element corresponds to a new lane starting
from lane1. Every element is an array. The number of elements in this
array is the number of cars in the same lane. Every element is a tuple.
Each tuple contains pos,vel for the car

Hallucinate a step forward given a specific car

`scene` Scene to start hallucination from

`car_id` Identity of the car of interest

---------NOTES:------------
- For now, we hallucinate the car of interest with the particle. Other cars are assumed to be
driving with IDM(v_des = 10). They don't matter in the particle update of the car of interest

- We return only the position of the car along the lane. We don't even return which lane it is
in information. In the future, we want to return 2D position and measure 2D likelihood value somehow
